# Webserv - HTTP Server Implementation

### Areas for Improvement
- Add more const correctness
- Consider splitting large methods (e.g., `processRequest()`)
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Create unit tests for parsing components
- Transfer-Encoding header handling

1. ✅ GET, POST, DELETE methods working
2. ⚠️ CGI execution (at least one type)
3. ⚠️ File uploads working
4. ✅ Configuration file parsing
5. ✅ Non-blocking I/O with epoll/select/kqueue
6. ✅ Error handling and status codes
7. ⚠️ Stress test stability
8. ✅ Browser compatibility

**Current Status**: ~75% complete  
**Critical Path**: CGI → Chunked Encoding → Stress Testing
